# youtube-shorts-redirect

Simple Firefox extension which redirects YouTube Shorts URLs (`youtube.com/shorts/id`) to normal video URLs (`youtube.com/watch?v=id`). This allows Shorts to be easily viewed using the default video player, instead of the Shorts player.

## Features
  - No more awful Shorts player!
  - Works when clicking on Shorts link directly from the YouTube site.
